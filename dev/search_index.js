Image data should be stored in WHCN order (width, height, channels, batch) or WHDCN (width, height, depth, channels, batch) in 3D context. Channels are assumed to be the penultimate dimension.\n\nExamples\n\nx1 = rand(32, 32, 4, 6) # a batch of 6 images (32x32) with 4 channels \nx2 = rand(32, 32, 4, 6) # a batch of 6 images (32x32) with 4 channels\nchcat(x1, x2) |> size\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#UNet.uchain-Tuple{}","page":"Home","title":"UNet.uchain","text":"uchain(;input, output, encoders, decoders, bridge, connection)\n\nBuild a Chain with U-Net like  architecture. encoders and decoders are arrays of encoding/decoding blocks,  from top to bottom (see diagram below). bridge is the bottom part of U-Net  architecture.  Each level of the U-Net is connected through a 2-argument callable connection. connection could be an array in case the way levels are connected vary from  one level to another.\n\nUsually encoders start with a 'MaxPool', except the first encoder\n\n+---------+                                                          +---------+\n|encoder 1|                                                          |decoder 1|\n+---------+                                                          +---------+\n     |------------------------------------------------------------------->^     \n     |                                                                    |     \n     |   +---------+                                         +---------+  |     \n     +-->|encoder 2|                                         |decoder 2|--+     \n         +---------+                                         +---------+        \n              |-------------------------------------------------->^             \n              |                                                   |             \n              |   +---------+                        +---------+  |             \n              +-->|encoder 3|                        |decoder 3|--+             \n                  +---------+                        +---------+                \n                       |--------------------------------->^                     \n                       |                                  |                     \n                       |   +---------+       +---------+  |                     \n                       +-->|encoder 4|       |decoder 4|--+                     \n                           +---------+       +---------+                        \n                                |---------------->^                             \n                                |                 |                             \n                                |    +-------+    |                             \n                                +--->|bridge |----+                             \n                                     +-------+                                  \n\nSee also chcat.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
